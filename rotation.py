"""
Local rotation and translation calculations for JAX mesh deformation. 
This module computes the local rigid transformation associated with each surface node. 
The transformation is represented by x -> M_i x + b_i, 
where ``M_i`` rotates the original surface normal to the deformed surface normal, 
and ``b_i`` ensures that the original surface point is mapped exactly to its deformed position. 

All numerical operations use JAX and remain compatible with JAX transformations and automatic differentiation.
